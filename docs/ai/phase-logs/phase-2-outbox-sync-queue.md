# Phase 2: Outbox Sync Queue

## Goal
Build a durable outbox sync queue on top of the Phase 1 Dexie foundation without replacing the whole app data flow at once.

## Current Baseline
Phase 1 added Dexie foundation, local schema, outbox types, local repositories, sync status helpers, and metadata/diagnostics coverage.

The current UI still primarily uses the existing server/TanStack/tRPC flow. Lists, items, views, tags, drag/drop, and optimistic updates are not fully local-first yet.

Phase 2 starts making queued local operations reliable, testable, and ready for gradual integration.

## Branch Structure
- Umbrella branch: `phase/outbox-sync-queue`
- Checkpoint branches branch from `phase/outbox-sync-queue`.
- Checkpoint branches merge back into `phase/outbox-sync-queue` only after validation.
- `phase/outbox-sync-queue` merges into `master` only after all Phase 2 gates pass.

Checkpoint branches:

- `checkpoint/phase-two-roadmap`
- `checkpoint/outbox-model-finalization`
- `checkpoint/outbox-repository-helpers`
- `checkpoint/outbox-coalescing-rules`
- `checkpoint/sync-replay-client`
- `checkpoint/sync-endpoint-contract`
- `checkpoint/basic-sync-status-surface`
- `checkpoint/phase-two-regression-docs`

## Checkpoint Plan

### 1. checkpoint/phase-two-roadmap
Purpose:

- Create this Phase 2 log.
- Reconcile Phase 1 documentation status if needed.
- No runtime behavior change.

Validation:

- `git status`
- `git diff --stat`
- Confirm docs-only change.

### 2. checkpoint/outbox-model-finalization
Purpose:

- Finalize outbox operation shape and semantics.
- Ensure `operationId`, `idempotencyKey`, `status`, and retry metadata are consistent.
- Add type guards if needed.
- No replay worker yet.

Validation:

- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`

### 3. checkpoint/outbox-repository-helpers
Purpose:
Add isolated Dexie helpers for:

- `enqueueOutboxOperation`
- `getPendingOutboxOperations`
- `markOutboxOperationSyncing`
- `markOutboxOperationSynced`
- `markOutboxOperationFailed`
- `markOutboxOperationDiscarded`
- `incrementRetryCount`
- `getOutboxOperationById`

Rules:

- Helpers must be isolated.
- Do not connect to UI yet.
- Do not connect to mutations yet.

Validation:

- Add/update unit tests.
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`

### 4. checkpoint/outbox-coalescing-rules
Purpose:
Add pure coalescing logic for pending operations.

Coalescing rules:

- Multiple updates on the same entity collapse to latest update.
- Multiple reorders collapse to latest order payload.
- Delete discards pending updates for the same entity.
- Create followed by delete can be discarded if unsynced.
- Move plus reorder should keep only final visible state where possible.
- Coalescing must be pure/tested before runtime integration.

Validation:

- Add unit tests for each coalescing rule.
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`

### 5. checkpoint/sync-replay-client
Purpose:
Add client-side sync replay foundation.

Allowed:

- A pure replay service that reads pending operations and calls a provided transport function.
- Retry handling.
- Status transitions.
- No automatic background interval yet unless explicitly tiny and disabled by default.

Required:

- `idempotencyKey` must be passed to transport.
- Replay must process in safe order.
- Replay must stop or isolate failures safely.
- Failed operations must not block unrelated safe operations unless ordering requires it.

Do not:

- Wire it into all app mutations yet.
- Auto-run sync globally without guardrails.
- Replace current server writes.

Validation:

- Unit tests with mocked transport.
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`

### 6. checkpoint/sync-endpoint-contract
Purpose:
Add server-side sync endpoint contract or documented contract.

Preferred:

- Start with contract/types and validation helpers before full endpoint behavior.
- If endpoint is added, keep it disabled or unused by UI unless explicitly scoped.
- Validate `operationId`, `idempotencyKey`, user ownership, payload shape, entity type, and operation type.

Do not:

- Trust client ownership.
- Accept unlimited payload size.
- Replay destructive operations without validation.

Validation:

- Unit tests for validation helpers.
- API tests if endpoint is added.
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`

### 7. checkpoint/basic-sync-status-surface
Purpose:
Add a tiny non-invasive sync status surface.

Allowed:

- Dev-only diagnostics component, or
- hidden/debug status utility, or
- minimal non-blocking indicator.

Do not:

- Add complex failed operation drawer yet.
- Redesign UI.
- Change dashboard data source.

Validation:

- Smoke E2E.
- Manual browser console check.
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run test:e2e:smoke`

### 8. checkpoint/phase-two-regression-docs
Purpose:
Finalize Phase 2 docs, validation evidence, known risks, and next phase recommendations.

Validation:

- `npm run test:ci`
- `npm run build` if env supports it.
- Manual dashboard regression.
- Confirm no hidden local-first rewrite.

## Phase 2 Manual Regression Checklist
Use when runtime behavior changes:

- App starts with `npm run dev`.
- Landing page loads.
- Login page loads.
- Dashboard loads existing server data.
- Create list still works.
- Rename list still works.
- Delete list still works.
- Create item still works.
- Rename item still works.
- Delete item still works.
- Reorder items within same list still works.
- Move item across lists still works.
- Drop item into empty list still works.
- Reorder lists still works.
- Switch views still works.
- Refresh keeps expected server state.
- Browser console has no Dexie, IndexedDB, hydration, tRPC, DND, or React errors.
- Network tab does not show unexpected request spam.
- Failed sync test does not corrupt visible state, if sync replay is integrated.
- Outbox operations do not duplicate after retry.

## Phase 2 Merge Gate
A checkpoint can merge into `phase/outbox-sync-queue` only when:

- Scope stayed inside checkpoint.
- Tests were added or updated for runtime behavior.
- Validation commands were run or skipped with exact reason.
- No unrelated refactors.
- Phase log updated.
- Known risks documented.

`phase/outbox-sync-queue` can merge into `master` only when:

- `npm run test:ci` passes.
- `npm run build` passes where env supports it.
- Smoke E2E passes.
- Authenticated E2E runs if dashboard behavior changed and credentials are available.
- Manual dashboard regression is documented.
- No unstable sync worker behavior is auto-running unexpectedly.
- No full dashboard local-first rewrite snuck into this phase.

## Phase 1 Documentation Reconciliation
Reviewed `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-1-dexie-foundation.md`.

No reconciliation edit was needed during `checkpoint/phase-two-roadmap`; the Phase 1 log already includes entries for:

- `checkpoint/local-repository-helpers`
- `checkpoint/sync-status-model`
- `checkpoint/first-dexie-integration`
- `checkpoint/expand-dexie-coverage`

## Checkpoint Log

### checkpoint/phase-two-roadmap
- Status: Ready for review.
- Date: 2026-05-10.
- Files changed: `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-2-outbox-sync-queue.md`, `docs/ai/00-ai-entrypoint.md`, `docs/ai/backlog.md`.
- Validation run: `git status --short --branch`, `git diff --stat`, and docs-only scope review.
- Manual validation: Confirmed no runtime source files were intentionally changed.
- Known risks: Phase 2 can easily overreach into dashboard source-of-truth changes. Keep each checkpoint narrow and update this log before merge.
- Next checkpoint: `checkpoint/outbox-model-finalization`.

### checkpoint/outbox-model-finalization
- Status: Ready for review.
- Date: 2026-05-10.
- Files changed: `lib/local-db/outbox-schema.ts`, `tests/unit/outbox-schema.test.ts`, `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-2-outbox-sync-queue.md`.
- Validation run: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:ci`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Manual validation: Not required for this checkpoint because the changes are pure model/type guards and are not connected to UI, mutations, tRPC, TanStack Query, drag/drop, sync replay, or server endpoints.
- Known risks: Guards validate operation shape and JSON-compatible payloads only. They do not validate entity ownership, entity existence, payload semantics per operation type, replay order, coalescing behavior, or server idempotency yet.
- Next checkpoint: `checkpoint/outbox-repository-helpers`.

### checkpoint/outbox-repository-helpers
- Status: Ready for review.
- Date: 2026-05-10.
- Files changed: `lib/local-db/outbox-repository.ts`, `tests/unit/outbox-repository.test.ts`, `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-2-outbox-sync-queue.md`.
- Validation run: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:ci`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test:e2e:smoke` passed.
- Manual validation: Not required for this checkpoint because the helpers are isolated and are not connected to UI, mutations, tRPC, TanStack Query, drag/drop, sync replay, or server endpoints.
- Known risks: Helpers only enqueue, read, and transition outbox records. They do not coalesce operations, replay operations, validate entity ownership, enforce server idempotency, or change dashboard data flow yet.
- Next checkpoint: `checkpoint/outbox-coalescing-rules`.

### checkpoint/outbox-coalescing-rules
- Status: Ready for review.
- Date: 2026-05-10.
- Files changed: `lib/local-db/outbox-coalescing.ts`, `tests/unit/outbox-coalescing.test.ts`, `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-2-outbox-sync-queue.md`.
- Validation run: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:ci`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Manual validation: Not required for this checkpoint because coalescing is pure logic and is not connected to UI, mutations, tRPC, TanStack Query, drag/drop, sync replay, or server endpoints.
- Known risks: Coalescing currently handles generic operation-level rules only. It does not apply discard markers to Dexie, inspect operation-specific payload semantics, validate entity ownership, or guarantee server replay safety. Move/reorder coalescing assumes the latest operation payload represents the final visible state.
- Next checkpoint: `checkpoint/sync-replay-client`.

### checkpoint/sync-replay-client
- Status: Ready for review.
- Date: 2026-05-10.
- Files changed: `lib/local-db/sync-replay-client.ts`, `tests/unit/sync-replay-client.test.ts`, `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-2-outbox-sync-queue.md`.
- Validation run: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:ci`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Manual validation: Not required for this checkpoint because replay is an isolated service with injected transport and is not connected to UI, mutations, tRPC, TanStack Query, drag/drop, automatic background jobs, or server endpoints.
- Known risks: Replay currently calls an injected transport only. It does not define the server endpoint contract, validate server ownership, auto-run in the app, persist advanced ordering constraints, or surface failed operations to users. Failed operations are isolated and retried later, but entity-level dependency ordering still needs endpoint/replay contract review.
- Next checkpoint: `checkpoint/sync-endpoint-contract`.

### checkpoint/sync-endpoint-contract
- Status: Ready for review.
- Date: 2026-05-10.
- Files changed: `lib/sync/sync-endpoint-contract.ts`, `tests/unit/sync-endpoint-contract.test.ts`, `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-2-outbox-sync-queue.md`.
- Validation run: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:ci`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Manual validation: Not required for this checkpoint because this adds contract validation helpers only. No tRPC router, API route, UI, mutation, TanStack Query, drag/drop, or automatic replay behavior was connected.
- Known risks: The live server endpoint is still not implemented. Contract validation checks request shape, idempotency key, authenticated user match, payload size, replayable status, entity/operation compatibility, and basic payload requirements, but it does not yet validate database ownership, entity existence, operation permission, order values against persisted state, or idempotency persistence.
- Next checkpoint: `checkpoint/basic-sync-status-surface`.

### checkpoint/basic-sync-status-surface
- Status: Ready for review.
- Date: 2026-05-10.
- Files changed: `lib/sync/sync-status-surface.ts`, `tests/unit/sync-status-surface.test.ts`, `docs/ai/phase-logs/phase-2-outbox-sync-queue.md`.
- Validation run: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:e2e:smoke`, `npm run test:ci`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Manual validation: Not required for this checkpoint because this adds a hidden/debug status display model only. No visible UI was mounted, and no tRPC, TanStack Query, drag/drop, mutation, automatic replay, or dashboard source-of-truth behavior was changed.
- Known risks: The status surface summarizes operation counts only. It does not read from Dexie, subscribe to live queue changes, expose a visible indicator, provide retry controls, or show failed operation details yet.
- Next checkpoint: `checkpoint/phase-two-regression-docs`.
