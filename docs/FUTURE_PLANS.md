# Future Plans

Single version-sequenced plan for Tidy. This file is the ONE owner of the roadmap;
`docs/VERSIONING.md` holds history + rules only. Every committed item carries its
target version. Only Potential Next Directions are unversioned. Update every phase.

Current version: see `STATE.json` (do not restate it here).

Version rules: patches (Z) may ship under the current minor before the next X/Y.
Inserting a new minor/major pushes later Planned numbers back to stay monotonic
(see the Planned Renumber Rule in `docs/VERSIONING.md`).

## Status Legend
- `Open`: not started
- `In progress`: active branch
- `Blocked`: needs an external decision/dependency
- `Done`: completed (struck through under Completed)

## In Progress

- 1.3.0 - Phase 3: View Filter Hardening (active branch `phase/view-filter-hardening`, checkpoint `fix-cross-view-list-moves`) - see Planned

---

## Planned

### 1.2.0 - ChromaDB Bootstrap
- **Status:** Open | Priority: workflow / startup reliability
- **Problem:** Startup calls query_docs.py but ChromaDB was never bootstrapped (chroma-data absent); the query silently fails.
- **Scope:** reconcile query_docs.py + ingest_docs.py vs hfk-system (collection tidy_docs); confirm chroma npm script + chromadb in requirements.txt; create + ingest chroma-data; port validate.ps1 auto-start + ingest block; wire the AGENTS.md offline guardrail.
- **Acceptance:** npm run chroma serves :8000; query returns a real tidy-doc chunk; validate auto-starts + ingests or FAILs loudly; startup reports online/offline honestly.

### 1.3.0 - Phase 3 Completion: View Filter Hardening
- **Status:** In progress | Priority: projection correctness
- **Phase log:** docs/PHASE_LOG.md (Phase 3)
- **Problem:** Lists created in All Lists or custom views do not consistently appear in other custom views when filter tags match.
- **Scope:** finish checkpoints 4-6; includes dashboard cache projection test coverage (selectedViewFromCache, projectView, list update/removal helpers, tag add/remove projection, view-selection projection).
- **Acceptance:** All Lists shows all lists; ANY/ALL custom views correct; retag/create/move/reorder/refresh/switch deterministic; matching projection tests; no Dexie expansion, source-of-truth rewrite, drag/drop rewrite, or broad tRPC rewrite.

### 1.4.0 - Ownership Hardening (Security)
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P0/P1 security
- **Files:** trpc/routers/listItemRouter.ts, components/list/ListsContainer.tsx, trpc/init.ts, trpc/routers/*.ts
- **Problem:** listItem getListItems/renameListItem/deleteListItem/setCompletionListItem are protected but do not verify parentList.userId; reorderListItems does not verify target list ownership.
- **Scope:** scope each listItem procedure through parentList.userId === ctx.userId (foreign ids -> FORBIDDEN/NOT_FOUND without mutating); reorder validates item ids AND target list ids before raw SQL (empty input still { success: true }); add ownership/API tests for list/listItem/tag/view ownership failures and unauthenticated -> UNAUTHORIZED.
- **Acceptance:** optimistic rename/delete/completion shapes unchanged; cross-list moves among owned lists still work; tests repeatable and documented.

### 1.5.0 - Product Polish
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1/P2 UX + correctness
- **Files:** app/layout.tsx, public/icon-clean.png, components/auth/Register.tsx, app/page.tsx
- **Scope:** fix metadata/asset mismatch (metadata references /apple-icon.png missing from public/ - add the asset or update the reference); Register submit copy says "Login" -> account-creation language; fix landing typo "optimisic" and generic "Simple Todo App" branding.
- **Acceptance:** metadata references existing assets only; no auth flow behavior change.

### 1.6.0 - Cache & Tag Maintainability
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 maintainability + consistency
- **Files:** trpc/routers/tagRouter.ts, trpc/routers/viewHelpers.ts, components/list/ListAdder.tsx, components/list/ListsContainer.tsx, components/list/ListComponent.tsx, components/list/ListTagPicker.tsx, lib/dashboard-cache.ts
- **Scope:** tag.removeFromList recompute once per logical remove; shared dashboard query-key helper (no key-shape change); replace string-matching invalidateViewPayloadQueries with typed/stable key matching.
- **Acceptance:** optimistic + invalidation behavior unchanged; custom-view membership correct after tag remove.

### 1.7.0 - Component Decomposition
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 maintainability
- **Files:** components/views/ViewsSidebarPreview.tsx, components/list/ListTagPicker.tsx, components/list/ListComponent.tsx, components/list/ListsContainer.tsx
- **Scope:** extract small named hooks/helpers from the large dashboard components.
- **Acceptance:** no query keys, mutation inputs, optimistic rollback behavior, or drag/drop invariants change.

### 1.8.0 - Test Coverage Expansion
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 correctness + regression prevention
- **Files:** trpc/routers/viewHelpers.ts, tests/, components/list/*, components/views/*
- **Scope:** view-helper recompute tests (empty tag sets, all-tags matching, previous-order preservation, all-lists fallback, no-match); E2E for list creation, tag changes affecting custom views, fast view switching, drag/drop reorder; documented auth/test-user setup.
- **Acceptance:** tests repeatable; authenticated E2E setup documented.

### 1.9.0 - Deploy Readiness
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 production readiness
- **Files:** README.md, .env.example
- **Scope:** document DATABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL; build/deploy steps note Prisma generate + migration expectations.

### 2.0.0 - Phase 4: Operation Coalescing
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 architecture
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, lib/dashboard-cache.ts
- **Scope:** outbox coalescing + replay client wiring.

### 2.1.0 - Phase 5: Rollback Safety
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 architecture
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, lib/dashboard-cache.ts
- **Scope:** Dexie-backed rollback for optimistic write failures; durable optimistic sync/offline strategy (in-memory queues currently lose pending writes on refresh/crash).

### 2.2.0 - Order Compaction
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 long-term data health
- **Files:** trpc/routers/listRouter.ts, trpc/routers/listItemRouter.ts, trpc/routers/viewRouter.ts, prisma/schema.prisma
- **Scope:** compaction strategy for sparse/negative order values over long-lived accounts.

### 3.0.0 - Phase 6: Scale Prep
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 performance
- **Files:** components/list/ListsContainer.tsx, trpc/routers/viewHelpers.ts, lib/dashboard-cache.ts
- **Scope:** performance + query optimization; profile and optimize large accounts.

### 3.1.0 - Rate Limiting & Abuse Controls
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 production hardening
- **Files:** trpc/init.ts, trpc/routers/*.ts
- **Scope:** rate limiting + abuse controls.

### 3.2.0 - Phase 8: Observability
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 operations
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, trpc/routers/*.ts, lib/optimistic-debug.tsx
- **Scope:** logging, error tracking, monitoring for API + sync failures.

## Potential Next Directions (unversioned)

Assigned a version only when scoped.
- PWA manifest, icon set, service-worker plan (app/layout.tsx, public/*)
- Mobile/touch drag-drop + responsive QA (components/list/*)
- Accessibility + UI polish pass (components/list/*, components/views/ViewsSidebarPreview.tsx)
- Sync or retire older root docs (docs/deprecated/*, README.md)
- Migration/backfill playbook (prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/migrations/*)

## Discarded / Won't Do

(none recorded yet)

## Known Cross-Cutting Risks

- No automated tests prove most optimistic race behavior yet
- PWA/offline is not implemented despite product goals
- In-memory queues can lose pending writes on refresh or crash
- Large components increase risk for focused changes
- API ownership gaps (1.4.0) should land before expanding API surface area
