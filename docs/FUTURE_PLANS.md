# Future Plans

Single version-sequenced plan for Tidy. This file is the ONE owner of the roadmap;
`docs/VERSIONING.md` holds history + rules only. Every committed item carries its
target version. Only Potential Next Directions are unversioned. Update every phase.

Current version: see `STATE.json` (do not restate it here).

Version rules: patches (Z) may ship under the current minor before the next X/Y.
Inserting a new minor/major pushes later Planned numbers back to stay monotonic
(see the Planned Renumber Rule in `docs/VERSIONING.md`).

## Status Legend
- `Open`: not started
- `In progress`: active branch
- `Blocked`: needs an external decision/dependency
- `Done`: completed (struck through under Completed)

## Planned

### 1.7.0 - Optimistic Queue Race Test Baseline
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P0 optimistic stability
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, lib/dashboard-cache.ts, tests/
- **Problem:** Most optimistic race behavior is not automatically proven, even though the app depends on optimistic-first UX.
- **Scope:** add tests or test harnesses for enqueue, replacePending, rollback, cancellation, and independent mutation scopes.
- **Acceptance:** test baseline captures current queue behavior and known race risks.

### 1.7.1 - Scope Rollback Rules
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P0 optimistic stability
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, lib/dashboard-cache.ts, tests/
- **Problem:** Rollbacks must not wipe unrelated newer optimistic work or repaint stale cache snapshots.
- **Scope:** define and implement safer rollback rules per optimistic scope; add regression tests.
- **Acceptance:** failed mutations only rollback their own intended changes; newer visible user actions are preserved.

### 1.7.2 - Pending Mutation Cancellation Rules
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 optimistic stability
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, components/list/*, components/views/*, tests/
- **Problem:** replacePending is correct for newest-state-wins flows, but unsafe if applied to actions where every mutation must persist.
- **Scope:** review and test replacePending usage for reorder and view selection; keep enqueue for actions that must persist.
- **Acceptance:** only newest-state-wins flows cancel earlier work; required user actions are not dropped.

### 1.7.3 - Refresh/Crash Pending Work Decision
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 local-first decision
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, lib/local-db/*, docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md
- **Problem:** In-memory queues can lose pending writes on refresh or crash.
- **Scope:** decide whether to keep in-memory queues temporarily or begin Dexie-backed pending writes; record durable decision in DECISIONS.md if architecture changes.
- **Acceptance:** future direction is explicit; no accidental half-offline rewrite.

### 1.8.0 - Local DB Role Audit Through Tests
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 local-first clarity
- **Files:** lib/local-db/*, hooks/use-local-db-health-check.ts, tests/unit/*
- **Problem:** Dexie/local DB exists as foundation but is not the dashboard source of truth.
- **Scope:** prove what local DB currently does and does not do through tests; clarify that runtime behavior remains server/TanStack-driven unless later changed.
- **Acceptance:** local DB role is tested and understood before offline integration work.

### 1.8.1 - Outbox Replay Integration Test Plan
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 offline architecture
- **Files:** lib/local-db/sync-replay-client.ts, lib/sync/sync-endpoint-contract.ts, tests/
- **Problem:** Outbox replay helpers exist but are not connected to real app mutations.
- **Scope:** plan and test the integration contract before wiring replay into runtime behavior.
- **Acceptance:** replay integration risks are covered by tests or explicit follow-up phases.

### 1.8.2 - Offline Write Path Prototype
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 offline prototype
- **Files:** hooks/useOptimisticSync.ts, lib/local-db/*, lib/sync/*, tests/
- **Problem:** Offline/PWA goals require a proven write path, but a broad source-of-truth rewrite is risky.
- **Scope:** prototype the smallest safe offline write path; keep feature flags or isolation if needed.
- **Acceptance:** prototype is tested, scoped, and does not silently replace dashboard source of truth.

### 1.9.0 - Dashboard Component Responsibility Audit
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 maintainability planning
- **Files:** components/list/*, components/views/ViewsSidebarPreview.tsx, lib/dashboard-cache.ts
- **Problem:** Large dashboard components increase risk for focused changes.
- **Scope:** identify extraction targets and invariants without changing behavior.
- **Acceptance:** extraction sequence is clear and test-backed; no extra product audit doc is added.

### 1.9.1 - Extract Dashboard Query Key Helper
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 maintainability
- **Files:** lib/dashboard-cache.ts or new small helper, components/list/*, components/views/ViewsSidebarPreview.tsx, tests/
- **Problem:** Query key construction is duplicated across components.
- **Scope:** extract shared helper without changing key shapes.
- **Acceptance:** query keys remain identical; tests or assertions prove no key-shape change.

### 1.9.2 - Extract List Mutation Cache Helpers
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 maintainability
- **Files:** lib/dashboard-cache.ts, components/list/ListAdder.tsx, components/list/ListComponent.tsx, components/list/ListsContainer.tsx, tests/
- **Problem:** List mutations duplicate cache logic.
- **Scope:** move list mutation cache behavior into named helpers while preserving optimistic behavior.
- **Acceptance:** existing behavior and tests remain stable; new or updated tests cover helper behavior.

### 1.9.3 - Extract View Mutation Cache Helpers
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 maintainability
- **Files:** lib/dashboard-cache.ts, components/views/ViewsSidebarPreview.tsx, tests/
- **Problem:** View mutation logic is concentrated in a large component.
- **Scope:** extract view create/update/delete/select cache helpers.
- **Acceptance:** view behavior, query keys, and rollback behavior do not change; tests cover extracted helpers.

### 1.9.4 - Extract Tag Mutation Cache Helpers
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P1 maintainability
- **Files:** lib/dashboard-cache.ts, components/list/ListTagPicker.tsx, tests/
- **Problem:** Tag mutation cache behavior is complex and easy to regress.
- **Scope:** extract tag mutation cache helpers after projection behavior is stable.
- **Acceptance:** affected custom views update correctly; tests cover helper behavior.

### 1.10.0 - Deploy Env Documentation
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 production readiness
- **Files:** README.md, .env.example
- **Problem:** Deployment environment expectations must be clear before production use.
- **Scope:** document DATABASE_URL, Supabase env vars, site URL, and local/prod differences.
- **Acceptance:** new setup can follow docs without guessing.

### 1.10.1 - Build/Migration Readiness
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 production readiness
- **Files:** README.md, prisma/*, package.json only if needed
- **Problem:** Build and migration expectations need a repeatable release path.
- **Scope:** document Prisma generate, migration, and build steps.
- **Acceptance:** production build/migration flow is clear and repeatable.

### 1.10.2 - Production Smoke Checklist
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P2 production readiness
- **Files:** README.md, docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md
- **Problem:** Production changes need a small smoke checklist after deploy.
- **Scope:** document login, dashboard load, create list, create item, tag view, reorder, and refresh smoke checks.
- **Acceptance:** smoke checklist exists and does not duplicate full test docs.

### 1.11.0 - Copy and Metadata Hygiene
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 late polish
- **Files:** app/layout.tsx, public/*, README.md if needed
- **Problem:** Metadata and public assets need cleanup, but this should happen after core behavior is trustworthy.
- **Scope:** fix missing asset references and metadata consistency.
- **Acceptance:** metadata references existing assets; no behavior change.

### 1.11.1 - Auth Flow Copy Polish
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 late polish
- **Files:** components/auth/Register.tsx, auth components if needed
- **Problem:** Auth copy should be clearer after core behavior is stable.
- **Scope:** fix misleading copy such as Register submit language.
- **Acceptance:** copy is clear; auth behavior unchanged.

### 1.11.2 - Landing Page Branding Polish
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 late polish
- **Files:** app/page.tsx
- **Problem:** Landing copy and generic branding can be improved after product correctness.
- **Scope:** fix typo and improve lightweight Tidy positioning.
- **Acceptance:** copy improves without changing app behavior.

### 1.11.3 - Visual Review Pass
- **Status:** Open | Priority: P3 late UI/UX
- **Files:** components/list/*, components/views/ViewsSidebarPreview.tsx, app/page.tsx
- **Problem:** Subjective UI/UX polish should be last because correctness matters first.
- **Scope:** perform a small visual review pass only after state correctness, ownership, optimistic behavior, and tests are stable.
- **Acceptance:** visual changes are small, reviewable, and do not alter data behavior.

## Potential Next Directions (unversioned)

Assigned a version only when scoped.
- Investigate why open-phase.ps1/promote.ps1's committed codebase-graph.json (fallback generator) reads as stale against validate.ps1's freshness regeneration, so the Section 2 graph refresh is not needed on every phase (scripts/generate-codebase-graph.ps1, scripts/generate_codebase_graph.py, scripts/validate.ps1)
- Rate limiting and abuse controls
- Observability
- Scale/performance profiling
- Order compaction
- PWA manifest, icon set, service-worker plan (app/layout.tsx, public/*)
- Mobile/touch drag-drop + responsive QA (components/list/*)
- Accessibility + UI polish pass (components/list/*, components/views/ViewsSidebarPreview.tsx)
- Sync or retire older root docs (docs/deprecated/*, README.md)
- Migration/backfill playbook (prisma/schema.prisma, prisma/migrations/*)

## Discarded / Won't Do

(none recorded yet)

---

## Known Cross-Cutting Risks

- No automated tests prove most optimistic race behavior yet.
- PWA/offline is not implemented despite product goals.
- In-memory queues can lose pending writes on refresh or crash.
- Large components increase risk for focused changes.
- API ownership gaps should land in 1.6.x before expanding API surface area.
- Frontend projection and backend refresh must agree before UI/UX polish.
