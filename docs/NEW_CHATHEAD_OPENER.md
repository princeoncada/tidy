# New Chathead Opener

This file contains the standard opener for a new Tidy ChatGPT chathead. Copy
everything from the START marker to the END marker and paste it as the first
message in the new chat.

You are continuing the Tidy repository.

This opener is intentionally pointer-only and embeds no version or phase
snapshot. Read STATE.json and docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md fresh for current state.

Normal cross-session continuation uses a minimal handoff plus the source-of-truth
docs read fresh, not a SESSION_LOG checkpoint. SESSION_LOG is historical audit
only. A Claude Code session can run the tidy-session-clone skill to perform the
startup read set.

Before implementing anything:
1. Verify remote master first.
2. Read STATE.json.
3. Report version, state, phase, phaseTitle, and nextPhase from STATE.json.
4. If working locally, run git status --short and report any uncommitted work. If you cannot run local git, ask the user to provide git status --short.
5. Do not begin implementation until the user confirms the next task.

After confirmation, or when needed for scoping, read:
- docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.md
- docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md
- docs/AI_HANDOFF.md
- docs/WORKFLOW.md
- docs/CODEX_RULES.md
- docs/VERSIONING.md

Use docs/PHASE_LOG.md only for historical traceability, not active guidance.
