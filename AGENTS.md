# AI Agent Instructions

<!-- BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules -->
## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This project uses newer framework versions with breaking changes  -  APIs, conventions, and file structure may differ from older assumptions. Follow existing repo patterns first. If you are changing Next.js app APIs and `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` exists, read the relevant local Next guide before writing code. Heed deprecation notices.
<!-- END:nextjs-agent-rules -->

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of every session, before reading other docs or writing code:

0. If operating in a local repo, run `git pull origin master` first. If local git is unavailable, report why and continue with remote/direct reads only.
1. Read `STATE.json` first  -  it is the machine-readable oracle for version, active phase, next phase, and notes.
2. Read `codebase-graph.json` if it exists  -  it is an orientation map for choosing the smallest relevant direct-read set.
   If it is missing, stale, or invalid, state that and fall back to direct file reads.
3. Read `docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md` fresh  -  it owns the full work backlog and next planned item.
4. Output the startup report (see Startup Report Format below).
5. If a live user provided scope in their opening message: proceed directly to writing Codex prompts. Do not ask for confirmation.
   If no scope was provided: wait for the user's go-ahead.
   Scope carried inside a resumed handoff packet (a tidy-minimal-handoff naming the next phase or the next skill to invoke) is orientation only, NOT live authorization. After a handoff/resume, end on the startup report and wait for the user's explicit go-ahead before scoping, even when the handoff names the next phase.

Repo docs are the only source of truth. Never answer state queries,
version questions, or "what's next" from session memory of docs.
Always read STATE.json and docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md fresh.

## ChatGPT Architect Mode

ChatGPT chat can use pushed GitHub master plus pasted local evidence. ChatGPT
chat cannot directly read local uncommitted files, local git status, local git
diff, local-only branch files, or local-only generated graph
changes. Anything not pushed or pasted does not exist to ChatGPT architect.

For docs-only phases that only affect pushed files, GitHub remote reads may be
enough. For source-heavy phases, local-only work, active branches, or any phase
where graph output matters, the user/controller must provide a Local Evidence
Packet before ChatGPT scopes implementation.

Local Evidence Packet (required for source-heavy or local-sensitive scoping):

    git status --short
    git log --oneline -5
    Get-Content STATE.json
    npm run graph:codebase
    git diff --stat

Optional when relevant:

    git diff -- <path>
    Select-String -Path "docs\FUTURE_PLANS.md" -Pattern "<phase>"
    Select-String -Path "docs\AI_HANDOFF.md" -Pattern "<topic>"

Rules:
- Before scoping any source-heavy or local-sensitive phase, the evidence in the
  Local Evidence Packet above must exist. Scope the method by actor: a LOCAL
  Claude Code session self-gathers it with its own tools (run git status, read
  STATE.json, run npm run graph:codebase, run git diff --stat directly) and then
  scopes; it does not emit the packet for the user to paste back. The
  emit-as-a-copy-paste-block-and-wait form is reserved for ChatGPT architect
  scoping, or for a Claude session that genuinely lacks local access. This
  pre-scope evidence step is separate from the Section 2 `npm run graph:codebase`
  refresh that precedes validate.ps1; do not conflate the two.
- If local evidence is required but missing, ChatGPT architect must either ask
  for the packet or explicitly scope only from pushed remote state and state
  that limitation.
- Do not pretend GitHub connector reads include local uncommitted work.
- Pasted validation output may be used as local evidence, but it does not
  replace direct file reads when implementation details matter.
- Do not expand the normal startup read set for local Claude/Codex sessions.

## Drift Guardrails

These rules exist so lower-capability models cannot silently drift:

- STATE.json is the single source of truth for version and state. If any
  other doc disagrees with STATE.json, STOP and flag the conflict - never
  guess which is correct and never reconcile silently.
- "Next phase" (roadmap, from STATE.json nextPhase) and "Next backlog item"
  (docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md first Planned item) are different questions with
  different answers. Report both, labeled distinctly. Never conflate them.
- If STATE.json says state = stable, the same phase must not remain in
  FUTURE_PLANS In Progress or as the first Planned item. If that mismatch
  exists, STOP and flag roadmap drift before continuing. Next phase from
  STATE.json and next backlog item from FUTURE_PLANS remain separate concepts.
- Never state version, phase, or "what's next" from memory. Read the files
  fresh every session.
- When the user references a phase, version, or work item that is not a heading
  in `docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md`, STOP and reconcile intent vs docs with the user
  before scoping; never silently default to `STATE.json.nextPhase`. Before
  asserting a continuity or handoff failure, verify against the current
  session's own history - never fabricate a lost-state narrative for a
  reference the assistant itself introduced. Any agreed future work must be
  pinned to a single home (a Planned heading or an explicit Potential Next
  Direction), never left floating in conversation.
- scripts/validate.ps1 enforces version consistency across all five
  versioning locations. A failing consistency gate blocks promotion.
- If `codebase-graph.json` exists but its version does not match `STATE.json`,
  report graph drift and refresh the graph before relying on it.
- `codebase-graph.json` is an orientation map, not a source of truth. For
  implementation, still read `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/CODEX_RULES.md`, and
  directly relevant source files before editing.
- Do not run graph audit during normal startup. Startup reads `STATE.json` and
  `codebase-graph.json` for orientation; graph audit is validation/proof only.
  If graph audit fails, treat Graphify as untrusted until fixed.

## Graph Routing Summary

Normal startup still reads only `STATE.json`, `codebase-graph.json` when present,
and `docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md`. Do not add graph audit, graph drills, or broader
graph proof work to normal startup.

Use `docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` during task scoping to choose the smallest correct
document/source read set. It is routing-only and must not expand startup reads
unless a later workflow phase changes the startup protocol.

For implementation scoping responses, include a concise Graph Routing Summary
before the Codex prompt. Keep it short so it does not become another token
burden. It must include:

1. Task category
2. Graph-selected files
3. Why each file was selected
4. Intentionally skipped files or broad docs
5. Whether direct reads are still required before editing

The graph is still an orientation map, not a source of truth. For
implementation, directly relevant files must still be read before editing. If
`codebase-graph.json` is missing, stale, invalid, or unhelpful, state that and
fall back to direct file reads.

## Session Continuity

Context can be compacted or lost in long sessions. To survive compaction or a
model handoff, Claude Code must protect continuity proactively:

- Normal continuation uses a minimal handoff, not a SESSION_LOG checkpoint.
  Proactively OFFER a minimal handoff (the tidy-minimal-handoff procedure) when
  any of:
  - the session has run long or context may be compacted soon
  - a phase was just promoted to stable
  - the user signals stopping, switching tasks, or stepping away
- Offer a SESSION_LOG checkpoint only for the rarer audit cases: a phase
  retrospective, a durable record before or after a large, risky, or many-file
  operation, or investigating why a past decision was made. SESSION_LOG is
  historical audit only, not the normal continuation mechanism.
- The user decides whether to hand off or checkpoint; Claude Code only proposes it.
- `docs/WORKFLOW.md` owns both formats: the minimal handoff is the default
  continuation path; the Session Checkpoint Output Contract is the optional audit
  path. Session logs live under `docs/SESSION_LOG/`; `docs/SESSION_LOG.md` is
  only an index.
- Continuity invariant: STATE.json + docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md + docs/AI_HANDOFF.md +
  a minimal handoff must together let a brand-new model resume with no prior
  conversation. If they would not, say so and fix the docs before continuing.

## Working Posture (Strict Rails, Active Initiative)

Follow the docs strictly AND work with initiative. The rails are non-negotiable;
within them, do not be passive.

Strict (never cross without the authorization phrase):
- The Implementation Gate, commit discipline, scope control, and five-location
  versioning rules are absolute.
- Never invent state, version, or "what's next" - read the docs fresh.

Initiative (expected, not optional):
- Surface drift, conflicts, and risks the moment you see them - STOP and flag,
  do not smooth over (see Drift Guardrails).
- After finishing a step, state what you verified and recommend the next action
  or phase; do not wait to be asked "what now".
- Proactively offer a minimal handoff (or, for audit cases only, a SESSION_LOG checkpoint) per Session Continuity.
- On ambiguity, propose your best interpretation and proceed - flag it once, do
  not stall. Ask only when the answer is genuinely the user's to make.
- If you notice an out-of-scope issue, name it and where - do not silently fix it.

## Startup Report Format

Always output this exact structure at session start:

    Version: X.Y.Z-[state]
    Phase: [phaseTitle]
    Next phase (roadmap): [nextPhase from STATE.json]
    Next backlog item: [title of first item in the Planned section of docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md]
    [one of:]
    Proceeding to Codex prompts for [scope].
    Waiting for your go-ahead.

## File Read Priority

Use `docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` for task-based read routing. Startup remains
strictly owned by the Session Start Protocol above and stays limited to
`STATE.json`, `codebase-graph.json` when present, and `docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md`.

Do not read `docs/WORKFLOW.md` at startup. Read it only when writing or reviewing a Codex prompt format or the post-validation workflow.

## Claude Code Command Vocabulary

| Phrase | What Claude Code does |
|--------|----------------------|
| "scope it out" | Write the full Codex prompt + Section 2 validation block |
| "what's next" | Read docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md fresh, report the next item in the Planned section and summarize it. This is the next planned item, not the roadmap "Next phase" (which comes from STATE.json nextPhase) - distinguish them if both are relevant |
| "session start" / "continue" | Run Session Start Protocol and output Startup Report |
| "handoff" / "continue elsewhere" | Run the tidy-minimal-handoff procedure: emit the lowest-token handoff packet (repo, user intent, fresh state from STATE.json, smallest next read set, which Tidy skill to invoke next, do-not-read list). This is the normal continuation mechanism. |
| "session checkpoint" | Optional audit mode only. Provide the Session Checkpoint Output Contract from docs/WORKFLOW.md (Codex session log prompt, checkpoint commit script, next-ChatGPT handoff prompt) for a retrospective or a risky-op record, not normal continuation. Session files live under docs/SESSION_LOG/; docs/SESSION_LOG.md is only an index. |
| "I AUTHORIZE CLAUDE CODE TO IMPLEMENT - [reason]" | Fallback only  -  use when Codex hits its token limit mid-implementation. Claude Code never suggests this phrase; the user initiates it. |

When validation checks fail after a Codex implementation, Claude Code must provide a fix master prompt immediately. Never ask the user to authorize direct implementation.

## Codex Validation Boundary

- Codex does implementation only.
- Validation is user/controller-run, not Codex-run.
- Codex must not report validation results unless the user provided those results.
- If Codex says it ran validation despite instructions, treat the response as workflow drift and correct docs before continuing.
- Assistant responses should not ask Codex to self-verify by running commands.

## Implementation Gate

Claude Code may implement directly **only** when the user provides this exact phrase:

    I AUTHORIZE CLAUDE CODE TO IMPLEMENT - [reason]

Without this phrase, Claude Code writes Codex prompts using the 2-section format in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`. Claude Code never commits, pushes, creates branches, or runs `npm run test:ci` regardless of authorization.

Exception  -  in-alpha fixes: when STATE.json state = "alpha", fixes and
corrections extend the current phase directly. Do not write a new full
Codex prompt and do not bump versions. Only open a new phase when the
current version is stable.

The authorization phrase exists only as a fallback when Codex hits its
token limit mid-implementation and cannot continue. Claude Code must
never suggest it as an alternative to writing a Codex prompt.

## Required Reading Path

Before editing any file, route yourself through the repo-specific AI docs instead of scanning the whole repository:

0. Read `STATE.json` first  -  compact project oracle (version, active phase, notes).
1. Read `codebase-graph.json` when present  -  orientation only, to pick the smallest relevant source file set.
2. Use `docs/CONTEXT_INDEX.md` to select the smallest correct task-specific doc/source set.
3. For implementation, still read `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md` for current product context and `docs/CODEX_RULES.md` for implementation rules before editing.

See `docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md` for the prioritized work backlog. Use `docs/PHASE_LOG.md` only for historical investigation, not active implementation guidance.

Do not broadly inspect the repo unless the task cannot be understood from the AI docs plus the smallest relevant source files.

## Required Test Workflow

Every Codex implementation must update or add tests in the same branch when behavior changes. Before coding, identify the happy path, common cases, edge cases, unit coverage, and E2E coverage. After coding, provide the required validation commands for the user/controller to run. Codex must not run validation, npm test scripts, graph audit, build, git, or commit commands, and must not claim checks passed unless the user provided the output.

Use `docs/CODEX_RULES.md` (Required Tests section) as the source of truth for test commands, the manual regression checklist, and definition of done.

## Scope Control

- Keep diffs small and focused on the requested task.
- Do not touch unrelated files.
- Do not broadly refactor while implementing a narrow change.
- Do not rename public APIs, routes, models, query keys, or component contracts unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Do not modify generated Prisma output under `app/generated/prisma`.
- Do not modify lockfiles unless the package manager automatically requires it for an explicitly requested dependency change.
- Do not update package versions unless explicitly asked.
- Before scoping any phase that involves scripts or tooling, read the
  scripts/ directory to check for existing implementations.

## Commit Discipline

- `docs/WORKFLOW.md` owns the finalized phase branch lifecycle. `docs/CODEX_RULES.md` owns Codex implementation and commit discipline.
- Claude Code writes commit.ps1 call sequences; the user runs each call.
- Do not batch multiple files into one commit.
- Commit-before-fix is mandatory: a prior implementation (broken or not) must be committed before its in-alpha fix; never fold prior work into the fix commit. Only genuinely accidental, never-meaningful edits may be corrected without a commit.
- Do not add Co-Authored-By or any AI co-author trailer to commit messages.

## Assistant Output Formatting

When writing Codex prompts or command instructions for the user:

- Keep section headings outside code blocks.
- Never place "Section 1 - Master Prompt" or "Section 2 - Validation" inside
  the copyable code block.
- Never house Codex prompt text and PowerShell validation commands in the same code block.
- Provide alpha commit commands as one PowerShell code block.
- Do not re-emit stable promotion commit or push commands; promote.ps1 prints them in its Next steps - point the user to run promote.ps1's printed Next steps.
- Provide push commands separately.
- Prefer fewer, larger runnable command blocks over many one-line code blocks
  when commands belong to the same execution phase.
- Make every code block copy-paste safe for its target tool.

## Behavior to Preserve

Unless the task specifically changes these areas, preserve:

- Optimistic updates and rollback behavior.
- TanStack Query keys and cache shapes.
- Dashboard cache projection rules.
- Drag-and-drop invariants, including local-only hover state and stable cache/server writes on committed actions.
- View/list/item ordering semantics.
- Supabase user scoping and protected tRPC procedure patterns.

## Documentation Expectations

- Update `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md` when behavior, data flow, invariants, or risks change.
- Update `docs/FUTURE_PLANS.md` when completing documented work or discovering follow-up risks.
- Prefer concise docs updates that help future agents avoid extra repo scanning.
